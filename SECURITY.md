# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The Refactored DuoFormer project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create a Public Issue

- Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues
- Do not discuss the vulnerability in public forums or social media

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **security@duoformer-project.com** (or create a private security advisory)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on complexity, typically 30-90 days

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with `bandit`
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type checking with `mypy`

### Input Validation

- **Data Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive config parameter checking
- **File Path Validation**: Secure file handling with path traversal protection
- **Model Input Validation**: Medical image input validation and preprocessing

### Dependencies

- **Pinned Versions**: All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly for security patches
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary dependencies included
- **Trusted Sources**: Dependencies sourced from official repositories

### Container Security

- **Base Images**: Official, minimal base images used
- **Layer Scanning**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Non-Root User**: Containers run as non-root user when possible
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in containers

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

```bash
# Always verify package integrity
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv duoformer-env
source duoformer-env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
duoformer-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### Data Security

- **Medical Data**: Ensure compliance with HIPAA/GDPR when handling medical images
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for medical datasets
- **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging for audit trails

### Model Security

- **Model Validation**: Validate model checkpoints before loading
- **Secure Storage**: Store trained models securely with appropriate access controls
- **Version Control**: Track model versions and changes
- **Inference Security**: Validate inputs during model inference

### Cloud Deployment Security

```bash
# Use secure configurations
export JUPYTER_TOKEN="your-secure-token-here"
export JUPYTER_PASSWORD_HASH="your-hashed-password"

# Enable HTTPS
jupyter lab --certfile=mycert.pem --keyfile=mykey.key
```

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Medical Data Handling

- **PHI Protection**: Ensure Protected Health Information is properly anonymized
- **Compliance**: Follow relevant medical data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- **Data Minimization**: Only process necessary medical data
- **Secure Deletion**: Implement secure data deletion procedures

### Model Training

- **Data Poisoning**: Be aware of potential data poisoning attacks
- **Model Inversion**: Consider model inversion attack risks
- **Adversarial Examples**: Implement defenses against adversarial inputs
- **Model Extraction**: Protect against model extraction attempts

### Deployment

- **Network Security**: Use secure network configurations
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Proper role-based access control
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and alerting

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We use the following tools for security scanning:

- **Bandit**: Python AST security scanner
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Docker Scout**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
